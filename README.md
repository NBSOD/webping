WebPing
=======

WebPing is a tiny utility to check availability of remote web pages. It
produces an HTML report to show results. It can send mails alerts when a page
can't be reached. It also search for a given string in the page and calculate
page response time.

This is basically a stupid and simple script. It was created at EDF for the
very specific needs of the internal intranet team but can be used in other contexts.

Requirements
------------

 * a Python interpreter (tested with Python 2.4.x), to build and run WebPing.
 * an access to internet, to let buildout download its dependencies via PyPi.
 * a web server (tested with Apache 2.2.x), to serve generated HTML reports.
 * a cron-like software, to "tick" WebPing regularly.
 * SQLite > 3.x.


Install and Setup steps
-----------------------

This how-to is designed around our current internal use of WebPing.
Don't forget to adapt it to you needs and your environment.

1. Install required system packages.

    * On RHEL 5.x:

            $ sudo yum install git gcc sqlite-devel python-devel

    * On Ubuntu 11.04:

            $ sudo apt-get install git gcc libsqlite3-dev python-dev

1. Check out the latest version of WebPing from GitHub:

        $ cd /var/www
        $ git clone git://github.com/kdeldycke/webping.git

1. Fix rights and ownership (quick and dirty):

        $ chmod -R 755 ./webping
        $ chown -R www-data:www-data ./webping

1. Initialize the buildout environment:

        $ su - www-data
        $ cd /var/www/webping
        $ python ./bootstrap.py --distribute

1. Run buildout itself:

        $ ./bin/buildout

1. Setup the cron file:

        $ sudo echo "*/10 * * * * www-data /var/www/webping/bin/webping" > /etc/cron.d/webping

1. Register WebPing's specific web configuration to your Apache server:

        $ ln -s /var/www/webping/apache.conf /etc/apache/conf.d/
        $ /etc/init.d/apache stop
        $ /etc/init.d/apache start

1. Eventually change WebPing config file to match your needs:

        $ vi /var/www/webping/webping.conf


Troubleshooting
---------------

<dl>

  <dt>
    Step 3  of the install process above is stuck when running the
    bootstrap script, and/or return a connection timeout error.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This may be due to your machine/user not having access to internet.
    Please carefully check your network/proxy configuration.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    Pages seems to be checked regularly but with a constant delay.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Check that the ntp server is properly configured and running on the
    server side.
  </dd>

</dl>
